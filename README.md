# Amazon-Scraper using JavaScript

Did ths project to understand and learn API requests

## Demonstration:
This is of format /products/:productId
http://localhost:5000/products/B08SC2ZTDP will give you output:
![Alt text](/scraper_op.png "Product details returned")



Go To amazon.in [Code works for amazon.in only at the moment]
https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Direct-Refrigerator-RR19A241BGS-NL/dp/B08SC2ZTDP/

B08SC2ZTDP is your productId

So in, http://localhost:5000/products/{replace this part with product Id} --> will give JSON output to get product details

Similarly,
This is of format /search/:searchQuery
http://localhost:5000/search/Victus will give you output:
![Alt text](/scraper_op2.png "Searched Product details returned")
